I'm Nicole, a web developer in the Portland-metro area. Most of my work on the front end has been in React, but I've recently picked up Vue. I'm primarily a front end dev, but I'm very comfortable working in Node.js and I've also dabbled in Java.

_I'm currently open to new opportunities. If you want to learn more, please check out my work and reach out!_
