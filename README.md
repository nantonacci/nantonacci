I'm Nicole, a web developer in the Portland-metro area. I'm currently a Junior App Dev at Rivermark Community Credit Union, where I work in C# (primarily .NET Core) and Vue.

In November 2020, I started working at Rivermark Community Credit Union as a Junior Application Developer. As a junior, I've worked closely with the Senior Developer to hone my skills and learn about the business processes of a credit union. It's been a wonderful experience working with a small team on projects that make a difference to the employees and customers of Rivermark.

In August 2020, I completed Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development curriculum. That included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in-depth work on React and Node.js. While I was a student there I also spent some time working as a Team Lead in order to hone my leadership and coding skills. I've learned a lot in a really short span of time, building apps from the ground up. All of this has been remote, working with many different people on collaborative projects. This included a lot of self-directed learning to accomplish my goals.
