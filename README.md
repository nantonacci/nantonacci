I'm Nicole, a web developer in the Portland-metro area. Most of my work on the front end has been in React, but I've recently picked up Vue. I'm primarily a front end dev, but I'm very comfortable working in Node.js and I've also dabbled in Java.

In August 2020, I completed Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development curriculum. That included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in-depth work on React and Node.js. While I was a student there I also spent some time working as a Team Lead in order to hone my leadership and coding skills. I've learned a lot in a really short span of time, building apps from the ground up. All of this has been remote, working with many different people on collaborative projects. This included a lot of self-directed learning to accomplish my goals.

My experience has given me a passion for learning new things. Most recently, I've been learning Vue and TypeScript. I really enjoy front-end work and have a lot of side projects currently in my rotation, including one working with the [Animal Crossing API](http://acnhapi.com/).

_I'm currently open to new opportunities. If you want to learn more, please check out my work and reach out!_
